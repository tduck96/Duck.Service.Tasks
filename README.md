# ðŸ¦† Duck.Service.Tasks

`Dumb simple microservice for handling the most mundane dev task ever: tracking tasks that need to get done.`

Just a humble to-do list service â€” built with the kind of architecture you'd normally reserve for, well, not a to-do list.
This is simply an attempt to apply the same patterns Iâ€™d use in real-world projects, but in a way thatâ€™s shareable (since work code isn't exactly portfolio material).

Built with .NET, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, and Docker Compose. Frontend coming soon in Angular.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Exists
Because I wanted to:

Build something simple but structured

Practice event-driven design using RabbitMQ

Use MongoDB for quick document modeling

Containerize everything with Docker Compose

Hook up an Angular frontend just for fun

Put some common service patterns into code, just to mess around with them

### ðŸ§± Architecture
[Angular UI] <---> [Duck.Service.Tasks (.NET API)] ---> [RabbitMQ] ---> [Other Services - TBD]
                                  |
                              [MongoDB]

.NET API for managing task CRUD

Emits events (task.created, task.updated, etc.) via RabbitMQ

MongoDB stores the tasks

Angular frontend connects to the API (WIP)
